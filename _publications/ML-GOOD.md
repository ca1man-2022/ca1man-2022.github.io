excerpt: 'In this paper, we tackle the emerging issue of multi-label graph out-of-distribution (GOOD) detection. We propose a label-specific energy function that effectively integrates multi-label information to compute GOOD energy scores, supported by theoretical analysis. Through extensive experimentation and discussion, we verify the efficacy of our approach, i.e., ML-GOOD. We aim to inspire further research into OOD detection for multi-label graph classification.'
