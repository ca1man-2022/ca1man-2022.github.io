I am currently a Ph.D. student in computer science from [ZJNU](https://www.zjnu.edu.cn/main.htm), Zhejiang, China. I received my BS degree in computer science and technology from ZJNU, in 2023.

My research interests are mainly in **Machine Learning on Graphs and Hypergraphs**, including out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, and OOD generalization.
